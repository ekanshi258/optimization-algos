# Nature-Inspired Optimization
Applications of Nature-inspired optimization algos in real life Engineering settings

### Disclaimer:
Since I'm a computer science major, I'm not an expert in the fields of engineering to which these problems are related.  
I'm only solving mathematical models of the problems using my knowledge of evolutionary algos, and have obtained these models from research papers in those fields. If there are any mistakes in the terminology I have used, or any issue with the maths behind the paper or translation of the math into my code, please let me know and I will be happy to correct them. Thanks!
