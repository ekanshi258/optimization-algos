Applications of Nature-inspired optimization algos in real life engineering settings

### Disclaimer:
I am a computer science major, meaning I am not an expert in the fields of engineering which these problems are related to. I am only solving mathematical models of the problems using my knowledge of evolutionary algos, I have obtained these models from research papers in those fields. If there are any mistakes in the terminology I have used, or any issue with the maths behind the paper or translation of the math into my code, please let me know and I will be happy to correct them. Thanks!

### Current Progress:
- Single Objective PSO for Civil Engineering based on [this paper](http://www.ijimt.org/vol10/832-CM0015.pdf) (`PSO-Concrete.ipynb`)
- Single Objective GA for Civil Engineering, based on the same paper as above.
- Structural design solution for a constrained problem, using NSGA II. Problem 1 (4.2.1) in [this paper](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/exportPdf?id=0b2c367b-f5d5-4214-9b55-fbde31e3b7ad)
